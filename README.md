## Problem - Traffic road accidents <a name='shortdesc'></a>
As compared to the South East Asia region, road fatality in Singapore ranked *higher* than countries like London, Hong Kong and Tokyo.
This issues are associated with factors such as high road congestion rates and high car ownership rate. 

#### Statistics 
* ###### Motorcyclist & pillion rider death rose by **3.3%** to **63%** 
* ###### Accidents involving elderly pedestrian rose by **33.6%** and fatality rose by **12.5%**

As population growth continues, our transport network will continue to be strained. 
This ultimately brings about dire circumstances as roads continue to be ticking timebombs for traffic accidents and fatalities. 

#### Impact of Emergency Medical Services 
According to SCDF, there were **23,000 cases** of Life and death cases in 2018 alone 

#### Machine Learning technologies  
- Detection libraries etc, Tech stack here-

#### The idea 
Our solution aims to integrate intelligence into current computerised system to monitor traffic accidents, to leverage on technology to improve the emergency response .
